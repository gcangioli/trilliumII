# The Trillium II IPS and its structure

The <b>Trillium II International Patient Summary</b> may be either a document, or a set of reusable data blocks that might be also used in a distributed environment.

Trillium II specifies two types of documents:
* the Trillium II International Patient Summary document; and  
* the Trillium II Healthcare Encounter Report

Both share the same IPS profiles and are represented by a composition resource.

The <b>Bundle</b> used for the transport or the persistence SHALL include all the resources that are referenced directly or indirectly by the used Compositions.

A complete list of the sections and of the used profiles is available in the <a href="ipsStructure.html">International Patient Summary Structure </a> page.
 

# List of Profiles

The links to the Profiles that have been defined for this implementation guide are listed hereafter.
