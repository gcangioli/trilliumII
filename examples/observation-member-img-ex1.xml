				Stress ECG Result:
			</p>
			<p>
 The patient was stressed by dobutamine infusion at a rate of 10 mcg/kg/minute for three minutes, 20 mcg/kg/minute for three minutes, and 30 mcg/kg/minute for three additional minutes. Atropine 0.25 mg was given intravenously eight minutes into the dobutamine infusion. The resting electrocardiogram reveals a regular sinus rhythm with heart rate of 86 beats per minute, QS pattern in leads V1 and V2, and diffuse nonspecific T wave abnormality. The heart rate increased from 86 beats per minute to 155 beats per minute, which is about 90% of the maximum predicted target heart rate. The blood pressure increased from 130/80 to 160/70. A maximum of 1 mm J-junctional depression was seen with fast up sloping ST segments during dobutamine infusion. No ischemic ST segment changes were seen during dobutamine infusion or during the recovery process.</p>
